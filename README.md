**About the Dataset**
The hotel is one of the lodgings most often used when traveling. With limited hotel capacity, canceling a reservation can be detrimental to the person providing the hotel service. In this case, we will predict hotel cancellations using data on Hotel Reservation Requests taken from Kaggle.
For full version and description of the dataset, you can check from Kaggle named [**Hotel Booking Demand**](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/)
